        it fails to parse the XAML. The suspected reason is that App.xaml (in PaZword) is
        somehow loaded by the unit test project, and that some magic makes that UnitTestApp.xaml 
        expect to find the same resources than in App.xaml 
        That said it's not verified, and no similar issue has been found on internet -->
